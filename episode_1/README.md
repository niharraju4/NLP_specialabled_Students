Filestructure


Here’s a detailed file structure for your project setup, which supports React Native for mobile (iOS/Android), React for web, and a Flask backend. This structure accommodates common code-sharing between platforms and manages payments, subscriptions, and UPI integrations.

Explanation of Each Directory
```
1. /packages
This directory contains both the mobile and web applications in separate folders.

/mobile-app: The React Native mobile app targeting iOS and Android devices.
/src/components: Mobile-specific UI components.
/src/api: Contains the code to interact with your Flask backend (for payments, subscriptions, etc.).
/src/screens: Contains different screens of the app (e.g., HomeScreen, PaymentScreen).
/web-app: The React-based web application.
/src/components: Web-specific components.
/src/api: Functions for calling backend APIs, similar to mobile.

```
2. /common
This folder contains code that is shared between both mobile and web. You can store shared components (like buttons or headers), utility functions (for formatting, etc.), and even some configuration files. This ensures code reusability across platforms.
```
/common/components: Shared UI components across both platforms (e.g., a common button).
/common/utils: Shared utility functions like formatting dates or making API requests.
```

3. /backend
This is your Flask backend, where you handle payments, subscriptions, and any other server-side logic.
```
/routes: Flask routes for handling API requests related to payments and subscriptions (e.g., creating Razorpay orders, handling payment confirmations).
/models: Database models (if you are using a database to store user info or subscription status).
app.py: The entry point for the Flask application.
requirements.txt: A list of Python dependencies required for the Flask application (e.g., Flask, Razorpay SDK).
```

Setting Up Your Monorepo (Using Yarn Workspaces)
To manage both mobile and web apps along with shared code in one project, you need to set up yarn workspaces.

1. Initialize the Monorepo
In the project-root, run the following command to initialize a new project:

```bash
yarn init
```

2. Add Workspaces to the Monorepo
Edit the package.json in the project-root to define the workspaces:
```
json
Copy code
{
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": {
    "packages": [
      "packages/mobile-app",
      "packages/web-app",
      "common",
      "backend"
    ]
  }
}
```

3. Install Dependencies for Mobile and Web
Navigate to the mobile-app and web-app directories and install the required dependencies for each platform.

For mobile-app:
```bash
cd packages/mobile-app
yarn add react-native-razorpay axios
```

For web-app:
```
cd packages/web-app
yarn add axios
```
4. Set Up the Shared Common Components
If you have any common components (like buttons), place them in the common folder and reference them in both mobile and web apps.
For example, in common/components/Button.js:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { TouchableOpacity, Text } from 'react-native';

const Button = ({ title, onPress }) => {
  return (
    <TouchableOpacity onPress={onPress} style={{ padding: 10, backgroundColor: '#3399cc' }}>
      <Text style={{ color: '#fff' }}>{title}</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  );
};

export default Button;
```

#####  In both mobile-app and web-app, you can now import the shared Button component like this:

```javascript
import Button from '../../common/components/Button';
```
```
Setting Up Razorpay Integration for UPI Payments
You’ll need to configure Razorpay for both mobile and web apps as outlined in earlier sections.

Mobile (React Native): Use the Razorpay React Native SDK in your mobile app to handle UPI payments.
Web (React): Use Razorpay’s Checkout.js to handle payments on the web.Make sure your Flask backend can handle order creation using Razorpay's API,
as described earlier.
```
Running and Testing the Apps
1. Mobile App (React Native)
For Android:

```
cd packages/mobile-app
npx react-native run-android
For iOS:
npx react-native run-ios
2. Web App (React)
cd packages/web-app
yarn start
3. Flask Backend
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
python app.py
```
Summary

```
This file structure helps you manage both mobile and web apps in one project using yarn workspaces for code sharing. You have:

/packages: Where your mobile (React Native) and web (React) apps live.
/common: A shared folder for reusable code.
/backend: A Flask backend handling subscriptions and payments (including UPI).
Each platform is capable of managing UPI payments using Razorpay.
```
