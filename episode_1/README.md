Explanation of Each Directory
```
1. /packages
This directory contains both the mobile and web applications in separate folders.

/mobile-app: The React Native mobile app targeting iOS and Android devices.
/src/components: Mobile-specific UI components.
/src/api: Contains the code to interact with your Flask backend (for payments, subscriptions, etc.).
/src/screens: Contains different screens of the app (e.g., HomeScreen, PaymentScreen).
/web-app: The React-based web application.
/src/components: Web-specific components.
/src/api: Functions for calling backend APIs, similar to mobile.

```
2. /common
This folder contains code that is shared between both mobile and web. You can store shared components
(like buttons or headers),utility functions (for formatting, etc.), and even some configuration files.
This ensures code reusability across platforms.

```
/common/components: Shared UI components across both platforms (e.g., a common button).
/common/utils: Shared utility functions like formatting dates or making API requests.
```

3. /backend
This is your Flask backend, where you handle payments, subscriptions, and any other server-side logic.
```
/routes: Flask routes for handling API requests related to payments and subscriptions
(e.g., creating Razorpay orders, handling payment confirmations).

/models: Database models (if you are using a database to store user info or subscription status).
app.py: The entry point for the Flask application.

requirements.txt: A list of Python dependencies required for the Flask application
(e.g., Flask, Razorpay SDK).
```

Setting Up Your Monorepo (Using Yarn Workspaces)
To manage both mobile and web apps along with shared code in one project, you need to set up yarn workspaces.

1. Initialize the Monorepo
In the project-root, run the following command to initialize a new project:

```bash
yarn init
```

2. Add Workspaces to the Monorepo
Edit the package.json in the project-root to define the workspaces:

```
json
Copy code
{
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": {
    "packages": [
      "packages/mobile-app",
      "packages/web-app",
      "common",
      "backend"
    ]
  }
}
```

3. Install Dependencies for Mobile and Web
Navigate to the mobile-app and web-app directories and install the required dependencies for each platform.

For mobile-app:
```bash
cd packages/mobile-app
yarn add react-native-razorpay axios
```

For web-app:
```
cd packages/web-app
yarn add axios
```
## 4. Set Up the Shared Common Components

If you have any common components (like buttons), place them in the common folder and reference them in both
mobile and web apps.
For example, in common/components/Button.js:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { TouchableOpacity, Text } from 'react-native';

const Button = ({ title, onPress }) => {
  return (
    <TouchableOpacity onPress={onPress} style={{ padding: 10, backgroundColor: '#3399cc' }}>
      <Text style={{ color: '#fff' }}>{title}</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  );
};

export default Button;
```

#####  In both mobile-app and web-app, you can now import the shared Button component like this:

```javascript
import Button from '../../common/components/Button';
```
```
Setting Up Razorpay Integration for UPI Payments
You’ll need to configure Razorpay for both mobile and web apps as outlined in earlier sections.

Mobile (React Native): Use the Razorpay React Native SDK in your mobile app to handle UPI payments.
Web (React): Use Razorpay’s Checkout.js to handle payments on the web.Make sure your Flask backend can handle order creation using Razorpay's API,
as described earlier.
```
Running and Testing the Apps
1. Mobile App (React Native)
For Android:

```
cd packages/mobile-app
npx react-native run-android
For iOS:
npx react-native run-ios
2. Web App (React)
cd packages/web-app
yarn start
3. Flask Backend
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
python app.py
```
Summary

```
This file structure helps you manage both mobile and web apps in one project using yarn workspaces for code sharing. You have:

/packages: Where your mobile (React Native) and web (React) apps live.
/common: A shared folder for reusable code.
/backend: A Flask backend handling subscriptions and payments (including UPI).
Each platform is capable of managing UPI payments using Razorpay.
```

2. creating monorepository
```
Let's break down the setup into a clear, step-by-step guide to help you integrate UPI,
subscription services, and other features into a cross-platform mobile and web application.

Final Project Setup for Cross-Platform Application (Mobile & Web)

This guide will focus on using React Native for mobile (iOS/Android) and a web-based application
using React.We will also cover how to connect your app with a Flask backend, where the business
logic(such as payment handling via Razorpay) will be managed.

Step 1: Choose a Cross-Platform Framework
For mobile (iOS and Android), you should use React Native. For web, you can either use React (web)
separately or React Native Web, which allows the same React Native codebase to work on both mobile and web.

React Native: Handles mobile (iOS and Android).
React (or React Native Web): Handles the web platform.
Step 2: Set Up a Monorepo for React Native and React Web
To handle multiple platforms (mobile and web), I recommend using a
monorepo setup, where both React Native (mobile) and React (web) share common code.

```

2.1. Install yarn Workspaces (for managing a monorepo)

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```
2.2. Create a Directory Structure for Your Project
```bash
/project-root
   /packages
      /mobile-app        # React Native project for mobile (iOS & Android)
      /web-app           # React project for web
   /backend              # Flask backend for managing payments, subscriptions, etc.
   /common               # Common code (components, utilities) shared across mobile & web
   package.json          # Top-level package.json to manage dependencies
```

2.3. Initialize the Monorepo Using Yarn
Inside your project-root, run:
```bash
yarn init
```
Then set up yarn workspaces by adding the following to your package.json:

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": {
    "packages": [
      "packages/*",
      "backend",
      "common"
    ]
  }
}
```


Step 3: Set Up the Mobile App (React Native)
Navigate to packages/ and create your React Native app:

```bash
cd packages
npx react-native init mobile-app
```
```bash
cd mobile-app

This will generate the mobile app folder structure inside packages/mobile-app. 
You can now set up UPI payments and subscriptions using Razorpay in this project 
as outlined earlier.
```

#### 3.1. Install Dependencies
Inside your mobile-app folder, install the required dependencies (such as Razorpay):

```bash
yarn add react-native-razorpay @stripe/stripe-react-native axios
```

3.2. Set Up Razorpay for UPI Payments
```
You’ll now follow the integration steps for Razorpay as outlined in earlier sections to set up 
UPI payments in the mobile app. Modify your App.js to include subscription flows and handle UPI 
payment using Razorpay's SDK.
```
Step 4: Set Up the Web App (React or React Native Web)

4.1. Navigate to the packages/ folder and create a React project:
```bash
npx create-react-app web-app
cd web-app
You can now build the web version of the platform. If you wish to share components between mobile and web,
consider using React Native Web.
```
4.2. Set Up UPI Payments on Web (Using Razorpay)
In web-app, install Razorpay’s payment handler for the web using their Checkout.js.
Inside your web-app, update the App.js to include Razorpay’s Checkout handling:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const handlePayment = () => {
  var options = {
    key: 'your-razorpay-key-id', // Enter the Razorpay Key ID
    amount: 5000, // Rs. 50 in paise (5000 paise)
    currency: 'INR',
    name: 'AI Learning Platform',
    description: 'Subscription',
    image: 'https://your-logo-url.com', // Your company logo URL
    handler: function (response) {
      alert("Payment successful: " + response.razorpay_payment_id);
    },
    prefill: {
      name: "Student Name",
      email: "student@example.com",
      contact: "9999999999",
    },
    theme: {
      color: "#3399cc",
    },
    method: {
      upi: true,
    },
  };
  var rzp1 = new window.Razorpay(options);
  rzp1.open();
};

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Subscribe to AI Learning Platform</h1>
      <button onClick={handlePayment}>Subscribe with UPI</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
This will enable UPI payments on the web.
```
Step 5: Set Up a Shared Common Folder (Optional)
In the common folder, you can store shared code like UI components, hooks, utilities, etc., which will be used by both your mobile and web apps.

Example:

```bash
/common
   /components
      Button.js  # Shared button component for both mobile and web
```

You can import this shared component into both your mobile app and web app by adjusting import paths:

```javascript
import Button from '../../common/components/Button';
```
Step 6: Set Up Flask Backend for Subscription and Payment Handling
```
Your Flask backend will handle payment and subscription management (using Razorpay) 
for both mobile and web apps.
```
6.1. Create the Flask Backend in the /backend Folder
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
pip install flask razorpay
```
6.2. Define Payment Handling in Flask
```
Add Razorpay order creation as shown earlier:
```python
import razorpay
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
app = Flask(__name__)
razorpay_client = razorpay.Client(auth=('your-razorpay-key-id', 'your-razorpay-key-secret'))

@app.route('/create-order', methods=['POST'])
def create_order():
    data = request.get_json()
    amount = data['amount']  # Amount in paise (5000 paise = Rs. 50)
    
    order = razorpay_client.order.create({
        'amount': amount,
        'currency': 'INR',
        'payment_capture': '1'  # Auto-capture payment after authorization
    })
    
    return jsonify({'id': order['id'], 'amount': order['amount']})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```
Step 7: Run and Test on All Platforms

7.1. Running the Mobile App
#### For Android:

```bash
cd packages/mobile-app
npx react-native run-android
```
For iOS:
```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```
##### 7.2. Running the Web App

Navigate to the web-app folder:

```bash
cd packages/web-app
yarn start
You can access the web app in the browser at http://localhost:3000.
```
7.3. Running the Backend
```
In the backend folder, run the Flask server:
```
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py
```
```
This will run the backend on http://localhost:5000.
```
#### Step 8: Deploy the Mobile App, Web App, and Backend
```
Mobile App: Deploy the mobile app to the Google Play Store (for Android) and App Store (for iOS).
Web App: Deploy the web app using platforms like Netlify or Vercel.
Backend: Deploy the Flask backend on a cloud platform like AWS, Heroku, or Azure to handle
payment processing for both mobile and web.
Conclusion
With this setup:
You have a monorepo structure that shares code between the mobile (React Native) and
web (React or React Native Web) apps.Both mobile and web apps handle payments through
Razorpay, including UPI.The backend (Flask) manages the subscription logic and payment
flow for both platforms.This unified approach ensures smooth development and deployment
across multiple devices, whether it’s iOS, Android, or the web.
```

Integrating payment gateway

```
To integrate UPI and other Indian payment methods (such as Netbanking, credit/debit cards, and wallets like
Paytm or PhonePe) into your AI-based audio learning platform, you can use a payment gateway that supports Indian
payment systems. Razorpay and PayU are two of the most popular payment gateways in India that support UPI and a
wide range of local payment methods.
Here’s a step-by-step guide to integrating Razorpay or PayU for handling subscriptions with UPI and other Indian
payment methods in your mobile app.
```
1. Choose a Payment Gateway
```
Razorpay: Provides comprehensive support for UPI, net banking, wallets, and cards in India.
Website: Razorpay
Supports: UPI, credit/debit cards, net banking, wallets (Paytm, PhonePe, etc.).
For this guide, we will use Razorpay due to its simplicity and wide range of integrations.
```
2. Set Up Razorpay for Indian Payments
   
2.1. Create a Razorpay Account
```
Go to Razorpay and sign up for an account.
Complete the KYC verification and set up your business profile.
```
2.2. Generate API Keys
```
In the Razorpay Dashboard, navigate to Settings -> API Keys.
Generate and save your API Key ID and API Key Secret.
These will be used in your mobile app and backend.
```
4. Integrating Razorpay into Your React Native Mobile App
```
Razorpay provides an official SDK for React Native, which makes it easy
to integrate payments, including UPI.
```

3.1. Install Razorpay SDK for React Native
```
In your React Native project directory, install the Razorpay SDK:
```bash
npm install react-native-razorpay
```
For iOS, make sure to run the following command after installation:
```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```
3.2. Link the Razorpay SDK
For React Native versions older than 0.60, you might need to manually link the Razorpay SDK:
```
react-native link react-native-razorpay
```

3.3. Modify Payment Flow in React Native
```
In your HomeScreen.js or wherever you want to trigger payments, import Razorpay and configure it:
```
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Button, Alert } from 'react-native';
import RazorpayCheckout from 'react-native-razorpay';
import axios from 'axios';

const HomeScreen = () => {

  const handlePayment = async () => {
    try {
      const orderData = await axios.post('http://YOUR_BACKEND_URL/create-order', {
        amount: 5000,  // For example, Rs. 50 subscription plan
        currency: 'INR',
      });

      var options = {
        description: 'Subscription for AI Learning Platform',
        image: 'https://your-logo-url.com',  // Add your logo URL
        currency: 'INR',
        key: 'your-razorpay-key-id', // Enter the Razorpay Key ID
        amount: orderData.data.amount,  // Amount is in paise (5000 paise = Rs. 50)
        name: 'AI Learning Platform',
        order_id: orderData.data.id,  // Order ID created in the backend
        prefill: {
          email: 'student@example.com',
          contact: '9999999999',
          name: 'Student Name'
        },
        theme: {color: '#F37254'}
      };

      RazorpayCheckout.open(options).then((data) => {
        // Payment successful, process the subscription
        Alert.alert('Success', `Payment successful: ${data.razorpay_payment_id}`);
      }).catch((error) => {
        // Payment failed
        Alert.alert('Error', `Payment failed: ${error.description}`);
      });
    } catch (error) {
      Alert.alert('Error', 'Unable to initiate payment. Please try again.');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Button title="Subscribe using UPI/Indian Payments" onPress={handlePayment} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default HomeScreen;
```
4. Set Up the Backend to Create Razorpay Orders (Flask)
```
To handle payments in your backend, you need to create orders with Razorpay using the
server-side APIs.
```

4.1. Install Razorpay Python SDK
In your Flask backend, install the Razorpay Python SDK:

```bash
pip install razorpay
```
4.2. Create Razorpay Orders in the Backend
```
In your app.py, create a new route to generate orders using the Razorpay API.
```
```python
import razorpay
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

app = Flask(__name__)

# Initialize Razorpay client
razorpay_client = razorpay.Client(auth=('your-razorpay-key-id', 'your-razorpay-key-secret'))

@app.route('/create-order', methods=['POST'])
def create_order():
    try:
        data = request.get_json()
        amount = data['amount']  # Amount in paise (e.g., 5000 paise = Rs. 50)
        
        # Create a Razorpay order
        order = razorpay_client.order.create({
            'amount': amount,
            'currency': 'INR',
            'payment_capture': '1'  # Auto-capture payment after authorization
        })
        
        return jsonify({'id': order['id'], 'amount': order['amount']})
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 400

```
4.3. Capture the Payment
```
Once a successful payment is made (confirmed on the mobile app), capture the payment using
Razorpay's APIs if necessary. Razorpay automatically captures payments if payment_capture is
set to 1 in the order creation process, as shown above.
```

5. UPI-Specific Payment Flow (Optional)
```
You can customize Razorpay's payment options to prioritize UPI for users:
Modify the options object in the payment flow to include UPI as the preferred method:

```javascript
var options = {
  description: 'Subscription for AI Learning Platform',
  currency: 'INR',
  key: 'your-razorpay-key-id',
  amount: 5000,
  name: 'AI Learning Platform',
  prefill: {
    email: 'student@example.com',
    contact: '9999999999',
    name: 'Student Name'
  },
  theme: {color: '#F37254'},
  method: {
    upi: true,
  }
};
```
Users will now be able to select UPI as their payment method directly.

6. Managing Subscriptions
```
Subscription Status: Store each user’s payment status in your database. Once a payment is successful,
update the user’s account to reflect the active subscription status.

Renewals and Cancellations: Razorpay supports automatic subscription renewals, so you can manage long-term
student subscriptions easily.
```
7. Additional Features

```
Discounts and Coupons: Offer special discounts or promo codes for students using Razorpay’s
coupons and discounts feature.
Receipts and Invoices: Automatically generate and send invoices/receipts for successful payments
through Razorpay's notification system.
```

8.Testing UPI and Indian Payment Methods
```
Razorpay provides a test environment for trying out UPI and other Indian payment methods
before going live. You can enable this in the Razorpay dashboard under "Settings".
Make sure to:
Test all payment flows with UPI, debit/credit cards, net banking, and wallets like Paytm or PhonePe.
Ensure smooth handling of both successful and failed payments.
```

#### 9. Deploying the Mobile App with UPI Payments
```
-Once your mobile app is integrated with UPI and Indian payment methods:
-Deploy the app to Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
-Ensure your backend (Flask) is deployed to a secure cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Heroku to handle order
creation and payment confirmations.
